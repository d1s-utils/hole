Simple and extensible storage service implementation with optional encryption.

## About Hole

Hole  is a simple data storage made with a soul for those who want to store
any data on their own server, easily access it using a convenient API, build
applications based on Hole and many other things.

Hole wasn't created with enterprise in mind, just because I wanted simplicity.
Although, you can always supplement the functionality of Hole by interacting
with its API.

### Main features

- Optional data encryption using [RNCryptor format](https://github.com/RNCryptor/RNCryptor-Spec/blob/master/RNCryptor-Spec-v3.md).
- Convenient API.
- Long-polling API.
- Object of unlimited size.
- User-defined metadata for each object.
